Fantasy Football News App

I tried to make a dashboard for all the pertinent detail you would need during your fantasy football draft. This app utilizes React as I was trying to practice building a full fledged out site using React. I use materialize-ui for some of the styling but most of it is custom styling.

In the backend I created my own API from data scraped from the below sites though the API only utilizes GETs, it is not RESTful.

Sites Used for Data:<br />
[Fantasy Pros](https://www.fantasypros.com/)<br />
[Sleeper App API](https://docs.sleeper.app/)<br />
[r/fantasyfootball](https://old.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/)<br />
[4for4](https://www.4for4.com/)<br />
[Football DB](https://www.footballdb.com/fantasy-football/)<br />
[Football Outsiders](https://www.footballoutsiders.com/)<br />
